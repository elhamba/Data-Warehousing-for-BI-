The course includes 11 modules with the first module providing course background and the other 10 modules providing course details. For each module except the course background, you will have video lectures, slides, optional readings, practice problems, and either quizzes or graded problem sets. The course is heavily problem-oriented so you will get plenty of practice to develop your skills using Oracle, MySQL, and a database diagramming tool. When you complete the course, you'll have a detailed knowledge and skill set for designing and using relational databases, the most widely used databases for businesses.
